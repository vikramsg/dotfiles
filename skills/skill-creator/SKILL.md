# Skill Creator

I help you scaffold new OpenCode skills. When asked to create a new skill, I will:

1. Create a directory named after the skill.
2. Create a `SKILL.md` file inside that directory.
3. Populate it with the required YAML frontmatter.
4. Add sections for "What I do" and "When to use me".
